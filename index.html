			<h3>Week of Welcome</h3>
			<p id="article" class="article">The first step on entering the stage of college brings here in the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines. Around many activities and lessons that have been tackled, brings us back to an event that welcomed the freshmen and other new students in the university is the Week of Welcomes (WOW). This event brought unity and friendship to all the new college students participating in every kind of activities as a class or as a section and since it was the first event, most of the students were really excited to join on whatever activity that would come up but there are also some of the students that were shy and not participating very well. Many students were happy and were enjoying the performances prepared by other college students; they even called some new students to perform with them just to boost their confidence. One of the activities also included that in a section, a group of people should dance and everyone was enjoying. In the Week of Welcomes gathered everyone letting them learn that building new relationship with others would help benefit their ways on how to adjust in learning and letting them know that there are other people who are willing to help you. What better way to start a new bonding with other fellow students than having a whole week filled with fun activities and excitement together? Though it may take some time to adjust to other students but eventually it will. The purpose of the event is to allow the students to feel comfortable of the university that they are enrolled in. So far because of the event, most of the students are now getting used to the university and the relationship of every class and section have improved quite well. There are neither signs of negative feedback coming from students about the university nor any complaints on their learning experience in the university. The Week of Welcomes was a successful event and it wouldn’t have been done without the help of some college students and other faculties that made all new students, especially the freshmen colleges, felt welcomed. </p>

			<h3>INTRAMURAL GAMES</h3>
			<p id="article" class="article">
	It was a hot day in August 29, 2018 at the grand opening of the University of Science and Technology’s Intramural Games. Intramural Games are organized in a way for people of the same community to be involved in athletic competition with and against each other, and is separate from the intercollegiate athletic teams. The battle between different college departments (CITC, CEA, etc.) clash towards victory. In this special event, we witnessed the different skills of each student representing for each of their department to see who will stand at the top. Many students were participating sports activities while others are cheering for them. All of the players during the games are showing true sportsmanship in playing. There are also games that are not related to sports like cosplay. The hip hop dance competition was fun to watch for you can see that all of them are having their time expressing their feelings through dancing that they do not even mind if they win or lose but rather the thought of just being able to perform is enough. In the intramural games, students will be able to apply their talents and skills freely allowing others to notice it.</p>

	<p>Though from the intramural games of USTP, the most awaited parts are the team sports such as basketball and volleyball. It is where we can hear the most screams and cheers coming from different department. The way the players are so dedicated to the sport their playing. Every score in the game the cheerers would scream as loud as they can just to let the players know that they are doing great. Though this year, both basketball and volleyball were conquered by the CEA department and they were also the overall champion of the entire Intramural games 2018, but the true value of the event is that everyone was able to have their chance to participate. Some of the players may have regrets from their loss, but deep down they enjoyed having their time playing. At the last day, all the students were united and were celebrating together the closing of the USTP Intramural games 2018.  </p>

			<h3>UNO</h3>
			<p id="article" class="article">Uno is an American shedding-type card amusement that is played with an exceptionally printed deck. The original aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points, achieved by a player discarding all of their cards and earning points corresponding to the value of the remaining cards still held by the other players. As for the way we play UNO cards, we have our different rule/s. Just as simple as the last person who has card/s in his hand will be punished. So technically, our rule is to aim to leave no card/s in our hands. There are different kinds of Action cards that you can use to your advantage such as: skip, reverse, add two cards, change color, and add four cards with change color and other version of UNO cards has this plain colored cards wherein you can set the rule (majority of the player must agree). <br>

The deck consists of 108 cards, of which there are 25 of each color (red, green, blue, and yellow), each color having two of each rank except zero. </p>

<p>To start a hand, seven cards are dealt to each player, with the top card of the deck flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile. The player to the dealer's left plays first unless the first card on the discard pile is an action or Wild card. On a player's turn, they must do one of the following: <br>	<br>
		play a card matching the discard in color, number, or symbol <br>
		play a Wild card, or a playable Wild Draw Four card<br>
		draw the top card of the deck</p>
<p>UNO is a very popular card game in the whole world because it’s not restricted only for adults but the kids and teenager can play it too. Playing UNO is one of our time-killing hobbies. During our break time, we gather around and start to play UNO. Many people may find it childish game, but it’s actually isn’t childish at all. This game enhances not only our analytical and critical thinking skills but also our observation and tactical skills. Subconsciously, we became more vigilant in a good way. </p>

<p>Many say and witnessed that playing UNO destroys friendship, but as for us 1R6, it is our way of deepening our relationship with each other. Through this game we can learn from each other, from the way they respond and react to critical situation. Playing this game doesn’t only give us fun, but it also gives us mental calmness and stress relief. College life is indeed tough but with UNO we found something that can counter this negative aura around us.</p>
